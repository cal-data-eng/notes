# Spreadsheets
So far, we've seen relational, matrix, and dataframe data models with
rigid requirements (fixed, atomic, etc.), and we've also seen
semi-structured data models with more relaxed requirements (nested,
flexible, non-atomic). In this note, we'll introduce another data model
with \"relaxed\" requirements: the **cell-structured** data model.

Spreadsheets are a ubiquitous tool, used by as many as 10% of the world,
or 800 million people, and dates back to 1969, about as old as
databases. There are many use cases for spreadsheets, ranging from
professional, personal, and even here in education.

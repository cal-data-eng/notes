# Graph Databases
## Many-to-many databases in the real world

**Social network datasets**
- A follows B, A is a friend of B

**Internet dataset**
- Page A links to Page B

**Road network datasets**
- Road A is connected to road B

**Scientific literature datasets**
- Paper is written by author, cites another paper

**Scientific interaction datasets**
- Disease treated by drug, drug A and drug B have interactions

These (and more) motivate models of networked data, i.e., models of **graph data**.
